It is a Python library that helps in multi-dimensional arrays for mathematical operations using Numpy or Scipy. Theano can use GPUs for faster computation, it also can automatically build symbolic graphs for computing gradients. On its website, Theano claims that it can recognize numerically unstable expressions and compute them with more stable algorithms, this is very useful for our unstable expressions.\n",
