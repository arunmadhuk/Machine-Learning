    "##### Context\n",
    "We are working on the project of automatic Image colorization for the Texas Innovation Challenge(TIC). Hence for the training of the model I had to create this dataset, wherein gray scale images are taken as input and a and b components of LAB color space are taken as output. This is the first dataset I ever created , so please do share your reviews on it :):)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Content\n",
    "The dataset consists of two compressed zip files:\n",
    "(1) ab.zip : This contains 25 .npy files consisting of a and b dimensions of LAB color space images, of the MIRFLICKR25k randomly sized colored image dataset. The LAB color space generally takes up large disk spaces, hence is a lot slower to load. That is the reason, I divided this into 25 files, so that it can be loaded at the time of requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) l.zip : This consists of a gray_scale.npy file which is the grayscale version of the MIRFLICKR25k dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image dataset which I used was taken from the MIRFLICKR25k ."
